## CP Clear Cache Overview

CP Clear Cache adds a "Clear Caches" button/nav item to the main Control Panel nav – making it easier to quickly clear data and template caches from the CP.  

**Note that CP Clear Caches will only add the nav item for users who have access to the Clear Caches utility.** You can control access to this utility via the permissions settings under Settings -> Users.  

## Configuring CP Clear Cache

Nothing to configure.

## Using CP Clear Cache

Click the "Clear Caches" menu button, check the caches you want to clear, and go for it.
